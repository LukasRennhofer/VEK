**VEK (Vantor Engine Kernel)** is my personal experimental project aimed at creating a scalable and modular framework for building rendering systems and game engines with a focus on performance, clarity, and developer productivity.

## Overview

VEK serves as a foundation layer for custom engine development, offering a clean and extensible architecture designed to support **real-time graphics**, **simulation**, and **hardware interaction**.
It provides a set of tools and abstractions that allow developers to rapidly prototype and evolve complex engine systems without sacrificing control or performance.

## Origin

The project traces its roots to the **Vantor Engine**, my earlier 3D engine framework. Many of the original core systems were extracted, refactored, and generalized into what is now known as the **Vantor Engine Kernel (VEK)**.
The goal was to turn a monolithic game engine into a reusable SDK—one that could serve as a base for new engines, experiments, or rendering backends.
